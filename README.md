description :Java file handling allows programs to perform essential operations such as reading, writing, and modifying files using classes from the java.io and java.nio packages. Reading a file involves retrieving its content for processing, which can be done using FileReader, BufferedReader, Scanner, or Files.readAllLines(), depending on whether line-by-line or full-content reading is required. Writing to a file involves creating or updating its content using FileWriter, BufferedWriter, PrintWriter, or Files.write(), where data can be appended or overwritten. Modification of a file typically requires reading its content, making necessary changes in memory, and then writing the modified data back, often using a combination of reading and writing techniques. Java ensures efficient and secure file handling with proper exception handling mechanisms like try-catch and try-with-resources to manage IOException and avoid resource leaks. These operations play a crucial role in handling persistent data in Java applications, supporting functionalities such as configuration storage, data logging, and document management.
